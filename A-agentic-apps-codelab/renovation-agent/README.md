# Renovation Agent

This folder contains an agent focused on renovation planning and recommendations. It is a compact example showing how to structure an app built with ADK for a specific domain.

Contents:
- `agent.py` — agent logic and example workflows.
- `requirements.txt` — dependencies required by this app.
- `.env` — environment variables for API keys. Do not commit.

Run / Usage:
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if present).
3. Provide API keys in `.env` and run `agent.py` as instructed in the file.

Notes:
- This README provides a short overview; consult `agent.py` for implementation details.
